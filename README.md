# Overview
This exercise is intentionally left open ended.  Within you will find a skeleton code base and a json file intended to simulate a database.
Notes from Surajit - I have added the Controller to the API project and have implemented the required methods. I have DI the IDataService to the controller so that the file operation task would be handled outside the controller and it gives the developer the option to inject the moq objects for performing Unit Testing. I have also added the Swagger documentation in the project.
